        <h1 id="#lifejournaling">Life Journaling for Beginners</h1>
            <p> Life journaling is a type of <strong>memory keeping</strong>, sometimes known as journaling or even a diary. 
                Many people in the paper crafting community already do life journaling without even realising it. 
                Life journaling is a mix between scrapbooking, the use of decrative paper and photos, and 
                the traditional streamline writing of journaling. Over the years of my experience I have found 
                a lot of people that do life journaling but no one has chosen a "coined" term for this method 
                of memory keeping.</p>
        
        <h2> What is Scrapbooking? </h2>
        <p>Scrapbooking, a crafting and documenting activity, involves taking books with blank pages 
            and adding <a href="supplies.html#tools">photos, memorabilia, journaling, and embellishments</a>. Also known as <em>cropping</em>, the 
            primary purpose of scrapbooking is to preserve memories for future generations, but a secondary purpose 
            often is to exercise your creativity as you display your memories in a scrapbook.</p>
